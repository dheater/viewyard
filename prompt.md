## Summary of Viewyard Python → Rust Migration Progress
   ### What We've Accomplished
   **✅ Core Architecture Complete (100%)**
   - Rust project structure with proper Cargo.toml and dependencies
   - Module organization: commands/, config, git, models, ui
   - CLI framework using clap with full argument parsing
   - Configuration system with serde YAML parsing (backward compatible)
   **✅ View Management Complete (100%)**
   - View creation with interactive repository selection
   - Git repository initialization and submodule management
   - Justfile generation for view-specific commands
   - View listing and deletion functionality
   - All tested and working with real git operations
   **✅ Workspace Operations Complete (100%)**
   - Status command showing repository states (clean/changes/unpushed)
   - Commit-all functionality for dirty repositories
   - Push-all for repositories with unpushed commits
   - Build command with configurable build scripts
   - All tested and working with comprehensive error handling
   **✅ Git Integration Complete (100%)**
   - External git command approach working perfectly
   - Submodule initialization and updates
   - Status checking and change detection
   - All git operations via std::process::Command
   ### Current State
   - **Repository**: `/Users/dheater/src/viewyard` (private GitHub repo)
   - **Backward Compatibility**: 100% - reads existing Python viewsets.yaml
   - **Feature Parity**: Core functionality complete and tested
   - **Performance**: Noticeably faster than Python version

   ## Resume Prompt
   Continue the Viewyard Python → Rust migration. We've successfully implemented and tested the core functionality:

   ✅ Complete: View management (create/list/delete), workspace operations (status/commit-all/push-all/build), git integration, and CLI framework
   ✅ All core features tested and working with real git operations
   ✅ Backward compatible with existing Python viewsets.yaml configuration

   Current repository: /Users/dheater/src/viewyard (private GitHub repo)
   Next priority: Implement the onboarding system for new users

   The core architecture is solid and proven. Focus on implementing the interactive onboarding flow that helps new users set up git configuration, create their first
   viewsets, and validate the setup. Keep the same pragmatic approach - simple, working solutions over complex abstractions.

   Continue as my critical Carl persona with direct, honest feedback.
   This will let the next session pick up exactly where we left off with full context of our successful progress.
